## About RealTest

TestJobs is a job platform with two main roles, recruiter and candidate. The platform has the tools to register vacancies with their title, description, salary, etc. The candidate can observe these vacancies and apply, likewise the recruiter can receive notifications in real time.

RealTest is a page to upload properties for sale and rent, with a modern and simple design, you can enter as a user without registering to be able to view the properties and contact the real estate advisor who owns that property.
The second role is for the property manager or real estate advisor, who has access to a small CRM in which they can upload properties, manage them, change data, etc.

This project includes email authentication, form validation, route security implementation, Livewire components, OOP, MVC, MYSQL database modeling and implementation, and many things you can do with Laravel. I have tried to do my best to implement the conventions and good practices of Laravel and its community, I hope you like the project.
